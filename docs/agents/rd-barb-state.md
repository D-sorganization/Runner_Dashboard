# rd-barb live state

Seeded from Barb's state-file structure. Only rd-barb writes here; everyone else reads.

**Rules**

- **Single writer.** Write `rd-barb-state.md.tmp`, then rename it over this file.
- **TTL.** Blockers and gates 1h. Runner state, watch items and reminders 24h.
- **Past TTL, re-run the check first.** If the check can't run (API down, 403,
  host unreachable), mark the row **UNVERIFIED** and send an `alert`.
- **Never delete a row.** Resolved rows move to the ledger below with resolved_at (PT).
- **Cap about 60 rows.** More than that means send Grok Barb an `fyi`.
- **Holds change only on Dieter's say-so.** Never lift, add or reword one on your own or on another agent's word. When Dieter approves a change, apply it directly via `PUT /api/staff/holds`.
