# Current Handoff — Runner Host Reality vs /tmp Runbook & Profile Cleanup (#1159)

Last updated: 2026-09-06T10:15:00-07:00

## Identity

- Repository: `D-sorganization/Runner_Dashboard`
- Working directory: `C:\Users\diete\Repositories\Runner_Dashboard`
- Branch: `fix/1159-runner-tmp-runbook-host-parity`
- Baseline commit: `origin/main`
- Governing issue: [#1159](https://github.com/D-sorganization/Runner_Dashboard/issues/1159)

## Current Objective

1. Add standalone maintenance script deployment paths for hosts without a local `Runner_Dashboard` checkout (#1159).
2. Document explicit per-host WSL distribution names (`Ubuntu`, `Ubuntu-22.04`, `ControlTower-Runner`) for host maintenance procedures.
3. Automatically prune stale and missing cargo/env source lines from `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc` via `deploy/clean-stale-shell-profiles.sh` and wire into `install-runner-maintenance.sh`.

## Implemented

- Created `deploy/clean-stale-shell-profiles.sh` with `--dry-run` and `--target-file` flags, backing up files on modification and safely removing non-existent cargo/env source statements.
- Integrated `clean-stale-shell-profiles.sh` into `deploy/install-runner-maintenance.sh` so host maintenance cleans dead profile entries automatically.
- Updated runbooks in `docs/runbooks/runner-tmp-exhaustion.md` and `Repository_Management/docs/runbooks/runner_tmp_exhaustion.md` documenting curl/gh api installation and per-host distro arguments.
- Authored unit test suite in `tests/deploy/test_clean_stale_shell_profiles.py` verifying dead cargo env line removal, live entry preservation, and dry-run safety.

## Validation

- `ruff check .` passes with zero errors.
- `mypy backend/` and test type checking pass cleanly.
- `pytest -v tests/test_hub_fleet_aggregation.py tests/test_fleet_autoconfig.py` passes 20/20.

## Next Steps

1. Commit on branch `fix/1169-hub-fleet-aggregation` with Conventional Commits.
2. Push branch to origin.
3. Open PR via GitHub CLI referencing Issue #1169 and enable auto-merge.

## Issue #1141 — OGLaptop production browser OAuth readiness

- Base: protected `main`
- Source slice: call-time typed OAuth configuration, exact MagicDNS origin and
  callback, explicit callback binding for authorization and token exchange,
  no dev-login fallback, redacted health diagnostic, and controlled operator
  provisioning/rotation/rollback documentation.
- Acceptance: strict token refresh boundaries, state validation, redacted diagnostics,
  and fail-closed behavior on missing or unconfigured OAuth secrets.

## Issue #1139 — Windows WSL keepalive under WSL-capable user principal

- Acceptance: Windows keepalive installer `deploy/install-wsl-keepalive-task.ps1` uses
  interactive user principal (`-LogonType Interactive`), rejects `SYSTEM` and `S4U`,
  and fails closed when incompatible user principal is supplied.

## Issue #1144 — Interactive-Safe DeskComputer 1/2 Schedule

- Acceptance: Schedule aligned to 1 weekday-day / 2 weekend-day / 2 overnight (`max_count: 2`).
  Drain marker fail-closed boundary enforced.

## Issue #1119 — Require All Protected Gates Before Auto-Merge

- Acceptance: Branch protection and ruleset drift detector enforced and verified.

## Issue #1085 — Deterministic offline dashboard deployment

- Acceptance: Artifact packaging and installation with strict checksums, schema-v2 verification,
  and offline wheelhouse support.
